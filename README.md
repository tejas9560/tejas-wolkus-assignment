The application must have user authentication ( Sign In/ Sign Up )
After logging in users will be navigated to the home screen where they should see a search option where they can search movies and see details of those movies. 
They can create a list of movies by adding the movies to lists. On the home page, different movie lists created by that user will be displayed.
These lists can be either public ( anyone with a link to the list can see this ) 
The Search & List page should have a nice layout, take inspiration from other websites/application
